        "body": "Due to PCOS, I have always had hirsutism and extra hair growth all my life - I have went through so many products to try to control the annoying amount of hair I produce. I've tried various women's razor's in the past, but those razors did not have women like me in mind ): For this particular issue, I was looking to deal with the ridiculous 70's p*rn bush my body develops if I don't decide to do a Brazilian or waxing. I saw in a passing comment on Reddit about women using a beard trimmer with a short guard to tame the bush down there, and thought \"why not, this is fairly cheap so if it doesn't work, it's whatever\". I am pleasantly surprised to share that this worked like a dream :) I used the shortest beard guard with the trimmer and I had no trouble removing the hair, was able to get a nice even trim, and had no issues or scares with getting hurt by the blade - in fact it was the most painless hair removal process I've ever had! I'm not hairless of course, but it's a nice change of pace compared to the jungle I was dealing with lol  The only thing I wish the razor had was an indication light to let you know when it's fully charged. I don't know why that wasnt a feature in the first place, but it at least has a good battery and you can charge for the indicated 8 hours to just be positive it's charged.  *As a note - I know that this product was intended for facial hair, but I believe it is important to advocate for women who deal with struggles like this and are looking for solutions that are rarely discussed. I hope this review helps out that one person who is looking for help with an issue they thought was unfixable",

I use all of the attachments and clips provided.  I like to keep my beard at a slightly longer length than just stubble, more “scruffy” if you will. The grey beard attachments glide across the skin well without hurting, and it only takes a few passes to get all the hairs trimmed as the motor is strong. I use the three shortest attachments, as different areas of my facial hair grow in more densely than other areas. When I’m finished, my beard has a picture perfect evenness to it that I know I can replicate every time, which excites me because my appearance is important in my line of work.  The hair trimming attachments are the real gem of this product that I did not anticipate using. I wouldn’t have thought to use them until I watched the product video provided. I use the longest length to trim the sides of my head around my ears, as I like to keep my hair longer on top to style it. This attachment cuts it short enough without showing the scalp/skin beneath.
