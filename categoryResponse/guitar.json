I play mostly on my office chair so I'm next to my computer screen for tabs and videos etc. My chair has fixed arm rests, which makes playing any regular guitar uncomfortable to impossible quickly, depending on body style. No problem with this little wonder! I don't use the arm rest in this case (I do on couch or other chair) and everything fits perfectly. My practice amp is a small Fender Mustang GT and this guitar sounds great through it. I don't miss not having a tone control, since I can just reach down and adjust on the amp if necessary, but rarely do. The acoustic setting sounds really nice and full, the mix between both pickups adds a nice crunch and the electric pickup also sounds great, split or not. The low weight is great, the non existing head stock prevents me from sweeping things off my desk, tuning is easy and the guitar stays in tune no problem. I'm not a pro, just play for my own fun, but the included gig bag is quite nice and everything fits great (though it would be nice if it were just an inch wider so the leg rest part can stay attached for playing) and when I travel and decide to take a guitar with me I have a little Blackstar Fly battery powered amp that works great. I'm sure I'll be more tempted to take this setup with me on vacation, over a full sized electric or acoustic guitar. There's only so much room for luggage for 4 people, this small thing will still fit easily. I bought it after injuring my foot and being pretty much chair locked and playing my regular guitars with my foot elevated and the arm rests on my chair started to really get uncomfortable. Glad I did and in hindsight I should have bought it a long time ago. Very happy with this easy to play and good sounding guitar. I don't like playing with (wired) headphones, some complain that a small headphone amp won't fit where you plug your cable in, a short cable (like you'd use between FX stomp boxes) would easily fix that though. Personally I like where the cable plugs in since it's on the inside and I don't have a plug sticking out and getting in the way with my arm rests on the chair etc. For my purposes this is a perfect design.Read more",

        "body": "I am so glad that I bought this Matte Black Mod-X instead of the Vintage White for the following reasons: 1. the Humbucker pickup with the single coil flip switch and the blend flip switch for hummbucker/mix/piezo pickup. 2. the location of the output 1/4 jack that quite a few customers blasted Traveler Guitar's engineer for putting it there. I think that due to the compactness and lack of space, it was put there so as not to jab into the leg of the guitar player if it was to put at the end of the lap rest. This is another reason I like this matte-black vs the vintage white as the white model has the 1/4 inch output jack on the outside of the lap rest and it would definitely jab into my leg. 3. inserting a headphone amplifier and leave it inside the output jack is okay as it won't hit anything if you put the guitar down. 4. both the humbucker and the piezo pickups are of good quality and they produced very nice clean sounds 5. the \"arm rest\" of the Mod-X is definitely a +++ for me otherwise my right arm would feel too empty while playing this guitar.  Yes, it took me a while to get used to this light and headless guitar with no pick guard and unusual tuning machine location. I managed to balance the nick of the guitar while I play by linking a stone beads bracelet on the neck's hanging strap. I even handmade a \"pick guard\" by buying a black pick guard sheet from Amazon and carefully measured and cut out 2 opposite matching pieces and just stick them together and then use a little bit of black tape to tape the corners onto the guitar. This made a big difference in playing with a \"pick guard\".
