          "body": "I've been shopping around for a new phone for over an month, I was tossed between the S22 Ultra and the OnePlus 10 Pro the issue was cost. I saw that a local brick and mortar store had the S22 Ultra for $250 off. which I was ready to pounce. I kept looking for a better price on the OnePlus. I found it here on Amazon for $719 with a $100 gift card so for $619 I got this phone. My previous phone is a OnePlus 7+ Pro McLaren (which I still have, no trade for this phone)  The OnePlus 10 Pro 5G arrived today (5-30-22) I did a google backup of the 7+ and booted the 10 Pro and it asks for a WiFi connection, then it updated, and it displayed a \"Would You Like to Transfer Your Data?\" using a cable. I clicked yes and connected the USB-C cable from the 7+ to the 10 Pro and it took 25 mins to transfer my 30 gigs of data. Then I added my google account and the phone started to restore from google backup automatically this procedure took another 25 mins.  After that I did the OnePlus Firm/Software update and rebooted the phone. My desktop picture was there and all the apps and your passwords are saved from google I did have to manually configure my emails (bluemail app) all my emails are stored on the cloud not a game changer. All the apps mine are 254 had short cuts on the desktop and it took me many hours creating folders to organize, but be patient its a one time procedure.  I do not like the front camera lens location it's in the upper left corner of the display, the 7+ had a pop-up lens.  Most people are complaining about the 128GB storage limitation and only 8GB RAM, as for storage if you are a Photo/Videophile then you already have cloud storage, I myself use OneDrive/Dropbox/Amazon Pictures which BTW has unlimited original quality uploads, if you are a member of Prime, I have over 106,000+ photos uploaded to Amazon, also you can get unlimited photo/video uploads to Facebook and set the album folders to \"private\" as for my videos I upload them as an unlisted video to my YouTube account.  Now for the RAM, yes the 10 Pro is @ 8GB RAM, but... you can get into settings and add virtual RAM in an Windows PC Environment this is called \"Pagefile\" the factory settings are for 3 GB virtual, (see pic) you can add or subtract if you want to custom it, OnePlus thought this one through to keep the cost down  The OnePlus Only widgets for time and temp are not scaled by the size of the frame. you change the frame size the display stays the same, you try to make the frame smaller the display scales with the size difference meaning you try to get rid of the open air and close in on the time display, nope (see pic) but there are 3rd party widgets that work better , that's what I did  For the price I am very happy with this purchase, yes I do wish they had larger storage than 128, but I use multiple cloud storage and if you have a paid Amazon account you get unlimited original size photo uploads, but only 5GB of Video uploads, and what I do is for videos is upload them to YT as an unlisted video and I have hundreds on my google account.  I have used the camera (see pic), not bad compared to the 7+ Pro the 10 is for the win  I Also used the screenshot push and hold the left side Vol up and the right button, or you can do the 3-finger swipe, and there are many variations to the 3 finger swipe  I do a lot of driving and my 2 go-to Apps ia Waze for traffic and YouTube Music, I now can \"Split Screen\" you put 3 fingers on the display and swipe up, it will split the 1st app then you add your 2nd (see pic)  To power the phone off you need to push and hold the left side vol-down and the right button as well  hope this helps if you want the OnePlus 10 ProRead more",

All the apps mine are 254 had short cuts on the desktop and it took me many hours creating folders to organize, but be patient its a one time procedure.<br><br>I do not like the front camera lens location it's in the upper left corner of the display, the 7+ had a pop-up lens.<br><br>Most people are complaining about the 128GB storage limitation and only 8GB RAM, as for storage if you are a Photo/Videophile then you already have cloud storage, I myself use OneDrive/Dropbox/Amazon Pictures which BTW has unlimited original quality uploads, if you are a member of Prime, I have over 106,000+ photos uploaded to Amazon, also you can get unlimited photo/video uploads to Facebook and set the album folders to \"private\" as for my videos I upload them as an unlisted video to my YouTube account.<br><br>Now for the RAM, yes the 10 Pro is @ 8GB RAM, but... you can get into settings and add virtual RAM in an Windows PC Environment this is called \"Pagefile\" the factory settings are for 3 GB virtual, (see pic) you can add or subtract if you want to custom it, OnePlus thought this one through to keep the cost down<br><br>The OnePlus Only widgets for time and temp are not scaled by the size of the frame. you change the frame size the display stays the same, you try to make the frame smaller the display scales with the size difference meaning you try to get rid of the open air and close in on the time display, nope (see pic) but there are 3rd party widgets that work better , that's what I did<br><br>For the price I am very happy with this purchase, yes I do wish they had larger storage than 128, but I use multiple cloud storage and if you have a paid Amazon account you get unlimited original size photo uploads, but only 5GB of Video uploads, and what I do is for videos is upload them to YT as an unlisted video and I have hundreds on my google account.<br><br>I have used the camera (see pic), not bad compared to the 7+ Pro the 10 is for the win<br><br>I Also used the screenshot push and hold the left side Vol up and the right button, or you can do the 3-finger swipe, and there are many variations to the 3 finger swipe<br><br>I do a lot of driving and my 2 go-to Apps ia Waze for traffic and YouTube Music, I now can \"Split Screen\" you put 3 fingers on the display and swipe up, it will split the 1st app then you add your 2nd (see pic)<br><br>To power the phone off you need to push and hold the left side vol-down and the right button as well<br><br>hope this helps if you want the OnePlus 10 Pro</span>   </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Toggle full review text\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>",

          "body": "Honestly, I was prepared to be disappointed based on how much bad light OnePlus has received lately. But I loved my 9 Pro and just wished it had a more competitive camera and battery life. The 10 Pro is a solid improvement worth trying despite sacrificing RAM and storage. I managed to move ~50GB to the cloud and am okay with the change, now I can fit plenty within the 128GB given. The RAM decrease has had no noticeable effect on me at all yet.  The SuperVOOC charging is neat, but not really that impressive compared to the 9 Pro. I was already happy with that speed, and this does shorten the time a bit more, but the real winner here is the 50w wireless charging. I haven't bought a corresponding charger yet, but due to the speed improvement I definitely will be. On that note, the battery size increase is also felt, and much appreciated. I feel confident in going a full day without needing to charge until at least bedtime - usually the 9 Pro needed a boost sometime around the early evening. The fast charging really cancels out the inconveniences of a smaller battery, though. You can't really complain much if you can give it more than enough power for the rest of your night within a few minutes.  I went with Volcanic Black despite my 9 Pro being green, but I got a much better deal on the price by doing so. The build quality, in my opinion, is also a slight improvement over the 9 Pro. The all-black looks sleek with the shiny metal frame and matte back. The black glass is also just really addicting to look and and feel. The pictures make it look a bit sandpaper-ish but it's very, very smooth.  I don't use my camera near as much I used to, but when I do I can still get picky over my picture quality and the 9 Pro left me wanting a bit more most of the time. The colors and sharpness on the 10 Pro are noticeably better than the 9 and I feel it was a worthwhile upgrade for this alone. I'd post some comparison shots if I hadn't already sold my old phone.  All in all, I do wish OnePlus would give us back a 256GB model, or a microSD slot, and having the RAM in case we do need it eventually would be cool, but I understand the chip shortage affects everyone. I was really trying to wait until they brought a 256GB model to the US, but no idea if that's happening, so I thought I'd go ahead and try this out. Glad I did!Read more",
